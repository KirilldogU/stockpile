description: |
  The naive bayes planner decides which links and abilities to execute at each step of the operation, by using statistics from past Caldera operational data. 
  It utilizes the user-passed flags of visibility (set in the advanced section of operation creation) and minimum link data (set in .yml) to make decisions adaptable to 
  user criteria and execute only links with the necessary confidence and data significance. Operations are automatically executed in the order of links' probability of success (high to low), 
  with links with insufficient data executing last and links with sufficient past data but an insufficient likelihood of success (based on visibility setting) being dropped altogether. 
  The NB planner allows for execution of operations with high confidence in each link and automatic prioritizing of more effective abilities.
