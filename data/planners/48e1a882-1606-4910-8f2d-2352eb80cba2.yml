description: |
  The naive bayes planner makes decisions on what links and abilities to run
  based on probability of success, determined from past Caldera operation history.
  It utilizes the user passed flags like visibility and confidence (*unimplemented corrently*)
  to make decisions adaptable to user criteria, and run only links with the necessary
  confidence and data significance.
